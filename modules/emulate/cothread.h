/**
* \addtogroup MOD_COTHREADS Cooperative Threads
* \brief Cooperative Processor Threads
* \author Alex Mykyta 
*
* Provides a lightweight method of implementing cooperative threads for the MSP430. Alternate thread
* contexts operate in separate stack space that can be dynamically allocated in the heap or from
* within the base thread's stack.
* 
* \warning No measures are taken to prevent stack overflows! Be sure to allocate enough stack space
* for the alternate thread. Make sure to account for any interrupt service routines that may trigger
* from within it.
* 
* \b Example \n
* In this simple example, two different threads control two separate LED outputs. When executed, the
* LED on P2.1 blinks three times, stops, then the LED on P2.2 blinks twice. This sequence repeats
* forever.
* 
* \code
* 
*	#include <msp430.h> 
*	#include <stdint.h>
*	
*	#include <cothread.h>
*	
*	
*	stack_t my_alt_stack[64];
*	
*	cothread_t home_thread; // Home thread object
*	cothread_t my_alt_thread;	// Alternate thread object
*	
*	int alt_thread_func(void);
*	
*	int main(void) {
*		WDTCTL = WDTPW | WDTHOLD; // Stop watchdog timer
*		
*		// Lets say that P2.1 and P2.2 are LEDs
*		P2DIR |= BIT1 | BIT2;
*		P2OUT &= ~(BIT1 | BIT2);
*		
*		// Initialize cothreads and populate the home thread object
*		cothread_init(&home_thread);
*		
*		// Setup the my_alt_thread object and create the new thread context
*		my_alt_thread.alt_stack = my_alt_stack; // it will use my_alt_stack for its stack storage
*		my_alt_thread.alt_stack_size = sizeof(my_alt_stack); // I hope its big enough!
*		my_alt_thread.co_exit = &home_thread; // If the thread exits, it will return to the home_thread
*		cothread_create(&my_alt_thread,alt_thread_func);
*		
*		while(1){
*			P2OUT |= BIT1; // P2.1 ON
