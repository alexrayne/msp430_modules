    \mainpage Overview
    
    Welcome to my collection of MSP430 C modules!
    
    Over the years I have developed a variety of drivers and services for TI's MSP430 series  
    microcontrollers. Since these modules have been developed on an "as I need them" basis, the
    collection is far from complete. Instead of letting them sit around unused on my hard-disk, I 
    have decided to release them to be used freely by the public.
    
    Below is a list of some of the programming philosophies I try to stick to when developing these
    modules:
    
    - <b> Configured at compile-time </b> \n
        Firmware design for microcontrollers tends to be quite static. It is rare that a small 
        system's configuration needs to be changed at runtime. For this reason, module configuration
        is generally done at compile-time using configuration *.h files and heavier use of the C
        preprocessor. Doing so reduces code size and RAM usage. Memory is always allocated statically
        (on the stack vs. using malloc) for more robust and deterministic design.
        
    - <b> Universal </b> \n
        These modules have been written to be compatible with as many of the processors as possible.
        Ideally, a program using these modules can be written for a 1xx device and then be 
        recompiled the next day for a higher-performing 6xx device with minimal modification.
        I tend to primarily use the 5xx family of devices so support will inevitably be best for
        those.
        
    - <b> Modular </b> \n
        With a few exceptions, the modules are written so that they can be used as completely
        standalone pieces of firmware that do not rely on other libraries. This makes them easy to
        drop in to a project as needed.

    \section SEC_COMPILER_SUPPORT Compiler Support
        Module code and makefiles are primarily designed to use the
        [msp430-elf GCC compiler](http://www.ti.com/tool/msp430-gcc-opensource). However in most
        cases, the TI compiler will work too.

    \section SEC_GETTING_STARTED Getting Started
            To help get you started, a few example projects have been included in the download and
            can be found in the "examples" folder.
            
            These projects should be compiled using the included makefiles. This can be done though
            a command line or from within Code Composer Studio by creating a custom makefile project
            (\e not a managed-make)
            
            In order for the makefiles to work, the following environment variables must be set:
                - \c PATH: Add the msp430-elf compiler's \c bin directory.
                - \c MSP430_HEADER_PATH: Set to point to the MSP430 header folder
                  (contains device-specific .h and .ld files)
            
            \b Examples:
                - \ref PG_EXAMPLE_BASIC - Blink some LEDs using a timer and control them with pushbuttons.
                - \ref PG_EXAMPLE_UART - Communicate with the MSP430 using a serial port
                - \ref PG_EXAMPLE_USB - Communicate with the MSP430 using the 5xx/6xx-series USB interface

    \section SEC_MODULE_BASICS Module Basics
        All code in this library is broken up into separate modules. Each module is made up of a
        collection of related functions, variables, and definitions.
        
        \subsection SEC_MODULE_COMPONENTS Parts of a Module
            Modules in this library are typically made up of several files that follow a consistent 
            naming convention. Some modules may require additional source files while others my only
            use a subset of the ones listed. Given a generic module called MODULE, its files may be
            organized as follows:
            
            - \b MODULE.c
                - Contains the source code for the module
            
            - \b MODULE.h
                - Contains definitions to functions and variables which provide an interface to the
                module.
                - When using a module in your project, this is typically the only header file that
                must be included.
            
            - \b MODULE_internal.h
                - Contains any internal definitions that are probably not useful to the end-user.
            
            - \b MODULE_config.TEMPLATE.h
                - Some modules are configured at compile-time by the pre-processor. This file is a 
                template configuration file that allows the user to modify some aspects of the
                module.
                - If a module comes with one of these files, it \e must be copied to your project's
                local config directory.
                - After copying the file, rename it to \b MODULE_config.h (remove "TEMPLATE." from
                the name)
                - This config directory \e must be added to the compiler's list of \#include search
                paths
            
            - \b MODULE.mk
                - This makefile instructs the compiler how to build the module.
